## Our goal
we created this game to exhibit the ramifications of gentrification and similar situations, but really it tackles the larger social issue of people not considering others in their own straightforward desire to win. the standard game format drives the human nature to "win" and plays on the concept of how little consequences games have. by forcing the player to play in both phases, the game disadvantages the player the more selfish they are and causes the player to understand the effects of their actions
